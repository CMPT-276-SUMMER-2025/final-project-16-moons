## Note
The website isn't fully responsive yet (looks best on 1920x1080 resolution), however this will be implemented in the future, along with other features and tweaks.
Due to the limitations of the project requirements, the recipe search by name feature uses API Ninja's recipe endpoint instead of TheMealDB's recipe endpoint, which results in less search results and recipe data.

## Project Description

Recipedia is a recipe generator that enables users to search for recipes while providing nutrition information for every meal. The app proposes a solution to two questions users ask: “What should I eat?” and “What’s the nutrition content of this meal?”. It aims to cut down on time spent trying to find meals that fit their nutrition goals and makes it easier to plan meals for the day. The app also gives users a variety of meals to choose from, based on certain preferences, such as ingredient or intolerances, to target a variety of dietary needs.
